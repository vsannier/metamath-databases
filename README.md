This repository contains the following Metamath databases:

| Logic/Theory                         | File     |
|--------------------------------------|----------|
| Natural deduction (NJ)               | `nj.mm`  |

(Please note that they have *not* been used extensively,
and may therefore be incomplete or even unsound implementations
of the above theories.)

It also contains a Lua script, `scripts/metalsmith`,
intended to replace several scripts hosted
at <https://github.com/metamath/set.mm/tree/develop/scripts>
for tasks such as listing theorems in a database, shortening proofs,
showing repetitions, etc.,
and a syntax file `misc/metamath.sublime-syntax` to be used with programs
like [Typst](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/).

Contributions are welcome.
